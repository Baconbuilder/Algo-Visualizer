# Algo-Visualizer

Hi! I'm Patson. I've built a web application that visualizes different algorithms as my CS50 final project.
I decided to make a web app that shows the process of sorting data arrays because it is something that I have been wanting to do for a while now, and I could learn a bit more about algorithms while making the web app.

## What is the web app built with?

The web application is built with HTML, CSS, vanilla Javascript, and Chart.Js.
The bar chart that displays different values is generated by Chart.Js, while the main logic of different sorting algorithms is written in vanilla Javascript.

## What does the web app offer?

The web application offers visualization of 5 sorting algorithms, which are Insertion sort, Selection sort, Bubble sort, Merge sort, and Bucket sort.
Besides visualization, there is some brief description(time complexity included) about the available sorting algorithms on the web app.

## How to use?

First, select a sorting algorithm you prefer. Then click "Start sort" to begin. If you would like to restart the process, click "Restart".
Feel free to try it out! https://visualizealgo.netlify.app/
